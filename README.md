# Shortestpath
Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph
Intially you can create nodes just by setting the mode to 'ADD' and clicking the mouse at the point where you wish to have a node.
Nodes are numbered automatically starting from zero.
using the text boxes at the bottom one can enter edge weight . the format is (sourcenode,destnode,edgeweight)
if edgeweight is zero then we cant see it.
To find the shortest path enter the source and destinations in the textboxes beside the "FIND"Button at the bottom.
The shortest path is drawn red.
One can use "CLEAR" to clear the screen
Other modes available are :
  DELETE: if one clicks on a node ,then that node will be deleted
  ADJUST: this mode is for chaging the node positions
  FIXED: this mode restricts node creation,deletion or adjust. It is particularly used to prevent accidental modifications
To adjust node positions click on a node to select it and click on the new location
