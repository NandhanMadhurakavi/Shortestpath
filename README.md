# Shortestpath
Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph
Intially you can create nodes just by clicking the mouse at the point where you wish to have a node.
Nodes are numbered automatically starting from zero.
using the text boxes at top-right one can enter edge weight . the format is (sourcenode,destnode,edgeweight)
if edgeweight is zero then we cant see it.
To find the shortest path enter the source and destinations in the textboxes beside the "FINDSHORTESTPATH"Button.
The shortest path is coloured red.
